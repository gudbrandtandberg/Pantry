### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gudbrandtandberg/Pantry

cd pantry-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Firebase configuration to .env

```

## Cost Considerations

Using Firebase's free tier for initial deployment:

- Authentication: 10K/month
- Hosting: 10GB/month
- Firestore: 1GB storage, 10GB/month transfer
- Cloud Functions: 125K invocations/month

These limits are more than sufficient for a family-scale application.
